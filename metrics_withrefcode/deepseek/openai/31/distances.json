The last column is the target class, while the rest of the columns are pixel values for images. How can I go ahead and split this dataset into a training set and a testing set (3 : 2)?Also, once that is done how would I also split each of those sets so that I can define x (all columns except the last one), and y (the last column)?I've imported my file using:dataset = pd.read_csv('example.csv', header=None, sep=',')ThanksA:use random_state=42<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pddataset = load_data()</code>x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = ... # put solution in these variablesBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
