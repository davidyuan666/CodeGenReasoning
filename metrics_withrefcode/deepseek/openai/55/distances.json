        "from_label": "Problem:I just start learning Python. Here is a data frame:a=pd.DataFrame({'A1':[0,1,2,3,2,1,6,0,1,1,7,10]})Now I think this data follows multinomial distribution. So, 12 numbers means the frequency of 12 categories (category 0, 1, 2...). For example, the occurance of category 0 is 0. So, I hope to find all the parameters of multinomial given this data. In the end, we have the best parameters of multinomial (or we can say the best probility for every number). For example,category:    0,      1,     2,     3,      4...weights:    0.001,  0.1,   0.2,   0.12,   0.2...So, I do not need a test data to predict. Could anyone give me some help?I know that Maximum Likelihood Estimation is one of the most important procedure to get point estimation for parameters of a distribution. So how can I apply it to this question?A:<code>import scipy.optimize as scioptimport numpy as npimport pandas as pda=pd.DataFrame({'A1':[0,1,2,3,2,1,6,0,1,1,7,10]})</code>weights = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
