For example, I have an array `a`:array([[10, 20, 30, 40, 50],       [ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10]])and I want to change it into, sayarray([[10, 30, 50, 40, 20],       [ 6,  8, 10,  9,  7]])by applying the permutation0 -> 01 -> 42 -> 13 -> 34 -> 2on the columns. In the new matrix, I therefore want the first column of the original to stay in place, the second to move to the last column and so on.Is there a numpy function to do it? I have a fairly large matrix and expect to get even larger ones, so I need a solution that does this quickly and in place if possible (permutation matrices are a no-go)Thank you.A:<code>import numpy as npa = np.array([[10, 20, 30, 40, 50],       [ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10]])permutation = [0, 4, 1, 3, 2]</code>a = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
