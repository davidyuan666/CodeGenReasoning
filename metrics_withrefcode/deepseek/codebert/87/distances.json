I want to bin that array into equal partitions of a given length (it is fine to drop the last partition if it is not the same size) and then calculate the mean of each of those bins. Due to some reason, I want the binning to be aligned to the end of the array. That is, discarding the first few elements of each row when misalignment occurs.I suspect there is numpy, scipy, or pandas functionality to do this.example:data = [[4,2,5,6,7],\t[5,4,3,5,7]]for a bin size of 2:bin_data = [[(2,5),(6,7)],\t     [(4,3),(5,7)]]bin_data_mean = [[3.5,6.5],\t\t  [3.5,6]]for a bin size of 3:bin_data = [[(5,6,7)],\t     [(3,5,7)]]bin_data_mean = [[6],\t\t  [5]]A:<code>import numpy as npdata = np.array([[4, 2, 5, 6, 7],[ 5, 4, 3, 5, 7]])bin_size = 3</code>bin_data_mean = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
