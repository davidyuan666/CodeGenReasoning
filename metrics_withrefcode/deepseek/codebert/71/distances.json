The column has two possible values, 1 or 0 ( so like a binary )I want to fill the NaN values in column X, but i don't want to use a single value for ALL the NaN entries.To be precise; I want to fill NaN values with \"0\" or \"1\" so that the number of \"0\" is 50%(round down) and the number of \"1\" is 50%(round down).Meanwhile, please fill in all zeros first and then all onesI have read the ' fillna() ' documentation but i have not found any such relevant information which could satisfy this functionality.I have literally no idea on how to move forward regarding this problem, so i haven't tried anything.df['Column_x'] = df['Column_x'].fillna(df['Column_x'].mode()[0], inplace= True)Since i haven't tried anything yet, i can't show or describe any actual results.what i can tell is that the expected result would be something along the lines of 8000 NaN values of column x replaced with '1' and another 8000 with '0' .A visual result would be something like;Before Handling NaNIndex     Column_x0          0.01          0.02          0.03          0.04          1.05          1.06          1.07          1.08          1.09          1.010         1.011         1.012         NaN13         NaN14         NaN15         NaN16         NaN17         NaN18         NaN19         NaN20         NaNAfter Handling NaNIndex     Column_x0          0.01          0.02          0.03          0.04          1.05          1.06          1.07          1.08          1.09          1.010         1.011         1.012         0.013         0.014         0.015         0.016         0.017         0.018         1.019         1.020         1.0A:<code>import pandas as pdimport numpy as npdf = pd.DataFrame({'Column_x': [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,np.nan,np.nan,np.nan,np.nan,np.nan,np.nan,np.nan,np.nan,np.nan]})</code>df = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
