I have tried to look among the distributions included in tensorflow_probability but I didn't find it.Please set the random seed to seed_x with tf.random.ser_seed().Thanks in advance for your help.A:<code>import tensorflow as tfseed_x = 10### return the tensor as variable 'result'</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
