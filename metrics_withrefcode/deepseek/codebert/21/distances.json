Please help me with the code below.import pandas as pdfrom sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifierfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectFromModelimport numpy as npdf = pd.read_csv('los_10_one_encoder.csv')y = df['LOS'] # targetX= df.drop('LOS',axis=1) # drop LOS columnclf = ExtraTreesClassifier(random_state=42)clf = clf.fit(X, y)print(clf.feature_importances_)model = SelectFromModel(clf, prefit=True)X_new = model.transform(X)A:<code>import pandas as pdfrom sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifierfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectFromModelimport numpy as npX, y = load_data()clf = ExtraTreesClassifier(random_state=42)clf = clf.fit(X, y)</code>column_names = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
