You can see the example later.I know that there is a function index_select. Now if I have the index, which is a LongTensor, how can I apply index_select to get the expected result?For example:the expected output:C = torch.LongTensor([[1, 3], [4, 6]])# 1 3# 4 6the index and the original data should be:idx = torch.LongTensor([1, 2])B = torch.LongTensor([[2, 1, 3], [5, 4, 6]])Thanks.A:<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdimport torchidx, B = load_data()</code>C = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
