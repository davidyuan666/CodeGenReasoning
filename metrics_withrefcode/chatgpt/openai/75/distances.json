All rows which have Type 1 are on top, followed by the rows with Type 2, followed by the rows with Type 3, etc.I would like to shuffle the order of the DataFrame's rows according to a list. For example, give a list [2, 4, 0, 3, 1, 5] and desired DataFrame should be:    Col1  Col2  Col3  Type2      7     8     9     24     13    14    15     30     1     2     3     13    10    11    12     21     4     5     6     15    16    17    18     3...I want to know how many rows have different Type than the original DataFrame. In this case, 4 rows (0,1,2,4) have different Type than origin.How can I achieve this?A:<code>import pandas as pdimport numpy as npdf = pd.DataFrame({'Col1': [1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16],                   'Col2': [2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17],                   'Col3': [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18],                   'Type': [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]})List = np.random.permutation(len(df))</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
