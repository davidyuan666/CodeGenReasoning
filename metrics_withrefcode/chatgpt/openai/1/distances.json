        "from_label": "Problem:I realize my question is fairly similar to Vectorized moving window on 2D array in numpy , but the answers there don't quite satisfy my needs.Is it possible to do a vectorized 2D moving window (rolling window) which includes so-called edge effects? What would be the most efficient way to do this?That is, I would like to slide the center of a moving window across my grid, such that the center can move over each cell in the grid. When moving along the margins of the grid, this operation would return only the portion of the window that overlaps the grid. Where the window is entirely within the grid, the full window is returned. For example, if I have the grid:a = array([[1,2,3,4],       [2,3,4,5],       [3,4,5,6],       [4,5,6,7]])…and I want to sample each point in this grid using a 3x3 window centered at that point, the operation should return a series of arrays, or, ideally, a series of views into the original array, as follows:[array([[1,2],[2,3]]), array([[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]), array([[2,3],[3,4], [4,5]]), array([[3,4],[4,5]]), array([[1,2,3],[2,3,4]]), … , array([[5,6],[6,7]])]A:<code>import numpy as npa = np.array([[1,2,3,4],       [2,3,4,5],       [3,4,5,6],       [4,5,6,7]])size = (3, 3)</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
