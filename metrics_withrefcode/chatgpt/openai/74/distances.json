For example, for category A, val1 is 7 and the row total is 36. The resulting value would be 7/36, so val1 is 19.4% of category A.My expected result would look like the following:cat  val1   val2   val3   val4A    .194   .278   .0     .528B    .370   .074   .037   .519C    .119   .357   .143   .381Is there an easy way to compute this?A:<code>import pandas as pddf = pd.DataFrame({'cat': ['A', 'B', 'C'],                   'val1': [7, 10, 5],                   'val2': [10, 2, 15],                   'val3': [0, 1, 6],                   'val4': [19, 14, 16]})</code>df = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
