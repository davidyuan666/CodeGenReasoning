And I just use the LinearSVC from sklearn library.I know that this LinearSVC will output the predicted labels, and also the decision scores. But actually I want probability estimates to show the confidence in the labels. If I continue to use the same sklearn method, is it possible to use a logistic function to convert the decision scores to probabilities?import sklearnmodel=sklearn.svm.LinearSVC(penalty='l1',C=1)predicted_test= model.predict(x_predict)predicted_test_scores= model.decision_function(x_predict)I want to check if it makes sense to obtain Probability estimates simply as [1 / (1 + exp(-x)) ] where x is the decision score.And I found that CalibratedClassifierCV(cv=5) seemed to be helpful to solve this problem.Can anyone give some advice how to use this function? Thanks.use default arguments unless necessaryA:<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdfrom sklearn import svmX, y, x_predict = load_data()assert type(X) == np.ndarrayassert type(y) == np.ndarrayassert type(x_predict) == np.ndarraymodel = svm.LinearSVC()</code>proba = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
