        "from_label": "Problem:I have been struggling with removing the time zone info from a column in a pandas dataframe. I have checked the following question, but it does not work for me:Can I export pandas DataFrame to Excel stripping tzinfo?I used tz_localize to assign a timezone to a datetime object, because I need to convert to another timezone using tz_convert. This adds an UTC offset, in the way \"-06:00\". I need to get rid of this offset, because it results in an error when I try to export the dataframe to Excel.Actual output2015-12-01 00:00:00-06:00Desired output2015-12-01 00:00:00I have tried to get the characters I want using the str() method, but it seems the result of tz_localize is not a string. My solution so far is to export the dataframe to csv, read the file, and to use the str() method to get the characters I want.Is there an easier solution?A:<code>import pandas as pdexample_df = pd.DataFrame({'datetime': ['2015-12-01 00:00:00-06:00', '2015-12-02 00:01:00-06:00', '2015-12-03 00:00:00-06:00']})example_df['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(example_df['datetime'])def f(df=example_df):    # return the solution in this function    # result = f(df)    ### BEGIN SOLUTION",
