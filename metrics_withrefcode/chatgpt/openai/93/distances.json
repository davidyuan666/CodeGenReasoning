        "from_label": "Problem:This question and answer demonstrate that when feature selection is performed using one of scikit-learn's dedicated feature selection routines, then the names of the selected features can be retrieved as follows:np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())[featureSelector.get_support()]For example, in the above code, featureSelector might be an instance of sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest or sklearn.feature_selection.SelectPercentile, since these classes implement the get_support method which returns a boolean mask or integer indices of the selected features.When one performs feature selection via linear models penalized with the L1 norm, it's unclear how to accomplish this. sklearn.svm.LinearSVC has no get_support method and the documentation doesn't make clear how to retrieve the feature indices after using its transform method to eliminate features from a collection of samples. Am I missing something here?Note use penalty='l1' and keep default arguments for others unless necessaryA:<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdimport sklearnfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizerfrom sklearn.svm import LinearSVCcorpus, y = load_data()assert type(corpus) == listassert type(y) == listvectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)def solve(corpus, y, vectorizer, X):    # return the solution in this function    # selected_feature_names = solve(corpus, y, vectorizer, X)    ### BEGIN SOLUTION",
