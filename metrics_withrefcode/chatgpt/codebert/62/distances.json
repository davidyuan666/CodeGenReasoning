Is a view on a DataFrame object not a valid input for the Series class ?I have found the to_series function for pd.Index objects, is there something similar for DataFrames ?A:<code>import pandas as pddates = ['2016-1-{}'.format(i)for i in range(1,21)]values = [i for i in range(20)]data = {'Date': dates, 'Value': values}df = pd.DataFrame(data)df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])</code>ts = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
