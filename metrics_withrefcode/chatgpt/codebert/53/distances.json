My GridSearch consists of 12 candidate models total.However, I am also interested in seeing the accuracy score of all of the 12, not just the best score, as I can clearly see by using the .best_score_ method. I am curious about opening up the black box that GridSearch sometimes feels like.I see a scoring= argument to GridSearch, but I can't see any way to print out scores. Actually, I want the full results of GridSearchCV besides getting the score, in pandas dataframe.Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.A:<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCVGridSearch_fitted = load_data()assert type(GridSearch_fitted) == sklearn.model_selection._search.GridSearchCV</code>full_results = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
