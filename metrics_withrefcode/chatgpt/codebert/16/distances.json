I was hoping for a function to return a pointer/reference to the matrix so that I can directly modify its value. ThanksA:<code>from scipy import sparseimport numpy as npimport mathsa = sparse.random(10, 10, density = 0.3, format = 'csc', random_state = 42)</code>sa = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
