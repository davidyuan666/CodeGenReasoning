I would like to calculate pairwise Manhattan distances between all regions to obtain the minimum distance separating the nearest edges of each raster patch.I've experimented with the cdist function from scipy.spatial.distance as suggested in this answer to a related question, but so far I've been unable to solve my problem using the available documentation. As an end result I would ideally have a N*N array in the form of \"from ID, to ID, distance\", including distances between all possible combinations of regions.Here's a sample dataset resembling my input data:import numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt# Sample study area arrayexample_array = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],                          [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 6, 0, 3, 3, 3],                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3],                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0],                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3],                          [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3],                          [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3],                          [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],                          [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],                          [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],                          [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]])# Plot arrayplt.imshow(example_array, cmap=\"spectral\", interpolation='nearest')A:<code>import numpy as npimport scipy.spatial.distanceexample_array = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],                          [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 6, 0, 3, 3, 3],                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3],                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0],                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3],                          [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3],                          [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3],                          [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],                          [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],                          [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],                          [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]])</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
