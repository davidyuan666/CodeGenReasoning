        "from_label": "Problem:Iâ€™m trying to solve a simple ODE to visualise the temporal response, which works well for constant input conditions using the new solve_ivp integration API in SciPy. For example:def dN1_dt_simple(t, N1):    return -100 * N1sol = solve_ivp(fun=dN1_dt_simple, t_span=time_span, y0=[N0,])However, I wonder is it possible to plot the response to a time-varying input? For instance, rather than having y0 fixed at N0, can I find the response to a simple sinusoid? Specifically, I want to add `-cos(t)` to original y. The result I want is values of solution at time points.Is there a compatible way to pass time-varying input conditions into the API?A:<code>import scipy.integrateimport numpy as npN0 = 10time_span = [-0.1, 0.1]</code>solve this question with example variable `sol` and set `result = sol.y`BEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
