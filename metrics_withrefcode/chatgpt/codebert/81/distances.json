Always comes with the parameters together. Is there some method of objects created to access only the name of the model, without its parameters. Or will I have to create an external list with the names for it?I use:for model in models:   scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)   print(f'Name model: {model} , Mean score: {scores.mean()}')But I obtain the name with the parameters:Name model: model = LinearSVC(), Mean score: 0.8066782865537986In fact I want to get the information this way:Name Model: LinearSVC, Mean Score: 0.8066782865537986Thanks!A:<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdfrom sklearn.svm import LinearSVCmodel = LinearSVC()</code>model_name = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
