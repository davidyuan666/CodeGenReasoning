I want to calculate mean on say columns 2,5,6,7 and 8. Can we do it with some function for dataframe object?What I know is do a for loop, get value of row for each element in row_index and keep doing mean. Do we have some direct function where we can pass row_list, and column_list and axis, for ex df.meanAdvance(row_list,column_list,axis=0) ?I have seen DataFrame.mean() but it didn't help I guess.  a b c d q 0 1 2 3 0 51 1 2 3 4 52 1 1 1 6 13 1 0 0 0 0I want mean of 0, 2, 3 rows for each a, b, d columns a    1.0b    1.0d    2.0A:<code>import pandas as pddf = pd.DataFrame({'a':[1,1,1,1],'b':[2,2,1,0],'c':[3,3,1,0],'d':[0,4,6,0],'q':[5,5,1,0]})row_list = [0,2,3]column_list = ['a','b','d']</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
