Is there a way to change this?And actually, I want my result X be like following instead, if the order of vocabulary is correct, so there should be one more step[[1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1][1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1][1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1][1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]](note this is incorrect but for result explanation)Thanks for answering!A:<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizercorpus = [    'We are looking for Java developer',    'Frontend developer with knowledge in SQL and Jscript',    'And this is the third one.',    'Is this the first document?',]</code>feature_names, X = ... # put solution in these variablesBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
