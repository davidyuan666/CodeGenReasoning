I have already carried out the clustering itself, just want to access the closest-to-centroid elements.What I want is the vector of the closest point to each cluster, i.e., result[0] is the vector of the closest element to cluster 0.A:<code>import numpy as npimport scipy.spatialcentroids = np.random.rand(5, 3)data = np.random.rand(100, 3)</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
