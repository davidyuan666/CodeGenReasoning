The resulting array should have the dimensions N x M. Here is the example as code:import numpy as npa = np.array( # dims: 3x3x2    [[[ 0,  1],     [ 2,  3],     [ 4,  5]],    [[ 6,  7],     [ 8,  9],     [10, 11]],    [[12, 13],     [14, 15],     [16, 17]]])b = np.array( # dims: 3x3    [[1, 1, 1],    [1, 1, 1],    [1, 1, 1]])# select the elements in a according to b# to achieve this result:desired = np.array(  [[ 1,  3,  5],   [ 7,  9, 11],   [13, 15, 17]])At first, I thought this must have a simple solution but I could not find one at all. Since I would like to port it to tensorflow, I would appreciate if somebody knows a numpy-type solution for this.A:<code>import numpy as npa = np.array( # dims: 3x3x2    [[[ 0,  1],     [ 2,  3],     [ 4,  5]],    [[ 6,  7],     [ 8,  9],     [10, 11]],    [[12, 13],     [14, 15],     [16, 17]]])b = np.array( # dims: 3x3    [[1, 1, 1],    [1, 1, 1],    [1, 1, 1]])</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
