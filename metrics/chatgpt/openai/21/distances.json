How can I achieve this using Pytorch?To illustrate, my Softmax outputs this:[[0.2, 0.1, 0.7], [0.6, 0.3, 0.1], [0.15, 0.8, 0.05]]And I must return this:[1, 2, 2], which has the type torch.LongTensorA:<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdimport torchsoftmax_output = load_data()def solve(softmax_output):</code>y = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
