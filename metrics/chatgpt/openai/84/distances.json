I am using ids = str(df.loc[0:index, 'User IDs'].values.tolist())However, this results in '[[1,2,3,4......]]' which is not I want. Somehow each value in my list column is type str. I have tried converting using list(), literal_eval() but it does not work. The list() converts each element within a list into a string e.g. from [12,13,14...] to ['['1'',','2',','1',',','3'......]'].How to concatenate pandas column with list values into one string? Kindly help out, I am banging my head on it for several hours.
