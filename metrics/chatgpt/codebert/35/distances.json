Or is this the only way?df.rename(columns={'HeaderA': 'HeaderAX'}, inplace=True)I have over 50 column headers and ten files; so the above approach will take a long time. Thank YouA:<code>import pandas as pddf = pd.DataFrame(    {'HeaderA': [476],     'HeaderB': [4365],     'HeaderC': [457],     \"HeaderX\": [345]})</code>df = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
