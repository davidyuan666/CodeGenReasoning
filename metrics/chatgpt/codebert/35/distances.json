It's supposed to have the same shape as the first two dimensions of a 3-dimensional array (an image, created via scipy.misc.fromimage).I'm very new to Scipy, and would like to know if there's a more elegant, idiomatic way of doing the same thing. I found the scipy.spatial.distance.cdist function, which seems promising, but I'm at a loss regarding how to fit it into this problem.def get_distance_2(y, x):    mid = ...  # needs to be a array of the shape (rows, cols, 2)?    return scipy.spatial.distance.cdist(scipy.dstack((y, x)), mid)Just to clarify, what I'm looking for is something like this (for a 6 x 6 array).
