The array has an X,Y coordinate system which originates in the top left corner: thus, position (0,0) is in the top left corner, while position (512,512) is in the bottom right corner.This is how the 2D array looks like (just an excerpt):X,Y,Value0,0,0.4820,1,0.490,2,0.4960,3,0.4950,4,0.490,5,0.4890,6,0.50,7,0.5040,8,0.4940,9,0.485I would like to be able to:Find the regions of cells which value exceeds a given threshold, say 0.75;Note: If two elements touch horizontally, vertically or diagnoally, they belong to one region.Determine the distance between the center of mass of such regions and the top left corner, which has coordinates (0,0).Please output the distances as a list.A:<code>import numpy as npfrom scipy import ndimagenp.random.seed(10)gen = np.random.RandomState(0)img = gen.poisson(2, size=(512, 512))img = ndimage.gaussian_filter(img.astype(np.double), (30, 30))img -= img.min()img /= img.max()threshold = 0.75</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
