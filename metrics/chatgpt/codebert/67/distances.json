For example,df = pd.DataFrame({'user':[1,1,2,2,3],                    'time':[20,10,11,18, 15],                    'amount':[10.99, 4.99, 2.99, 1.99, 10.99]})which looks like    amount  time  user0   10.99    20     11    4.99    10     12    2.99    11     23    1.99    18     24   10.99    15     3If I doprint(df.groupby('user')['time'].apply(list))I getuser1    [20, 10]2    [11, 18]3        [15]but if I dodf.groupby('user')[['time', 'amount']].apply(list)I getuser1    [time, amount]2    [time, amount]3    [time, amount]Thanks to an answer below, I learned I can do thisdf.groupby('user').agg(lambda x: x.tolist()))to get             amount      timeuser                         1     [10.99, 4.99]  [20, 10]2      [2.99, 1.99]  [11, 18]3           [10.99]      [15]but I'm going to want to sort time and amounts in the same order - so I can go through each users transactions in order.I was looking for a way to produce this dataframe:                  amount-time-tupleuser                               1     [[20.0, 10.99], [10.0, 4.99]]2      [[11.0, 2.99], [18.0, 1.99]]3                   [[15.0, 10.99]]but maybe there is a way to do the sort without \"tupling\" the two columns?A:<code>import pandas as pddf = pd.DataFrame({'user':[1,1,2,2,3], 'time':[20,10,11,18, 15], 'amount':[10.99, 4.99, 2.99, 1.99, 10.99]})### Output your answer into variable 'result'</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
