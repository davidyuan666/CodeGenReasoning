For example, if X = 52. then the result should be:   ID         date   close1  15-Sep-2007  123.453  25-Oct-2008  132.015  07-Nov-2009  145.997  03-Jul-2011  171.10If X = 7, the result should be:   ID         date   close1  15-Sep-2007  123.452  01-Jun-2008  130.133  25-Oct-2008  132.014  13-May-2009  118.345  07-Nov-2009  145.997  03-Jul-2011  171.10I've taken a look at a few questions here but haven't found the right approach. I have the following ugly code in place today that works for small X values but when X gets larger (e.g., when X = 52), it removes all dates except the original date. filter_dates = []for index, row in df.iterrows():     if observation_time == 'D':        for i in range(1, observation_period):            filter_dates.append((index.date() + timedelta(months=i)))df = df[~df.index.isin(filter_dates)]Any help/pointers would be appreciated!Clarification:The solution to this needs to look at every row, not just the first row. A:<code>import pandas as pddf = pd.DataFrame({'ID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],                   'date': ['09/15/07', '06/01/08', '10/25/08', '1/14/9', '05/13/09', '11/07/09', '11/15/09', '07/03/11'],                   'close': [123.45, 130.13, 132.01, 118.34, 514.14, 145.99, 146.73, 171.10]})X = 17</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
