The answer should be like a 3*5 matrix of the similarities.A:<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizerqueries, documents = load_data()assert type(queries) == listassert type(documents) == listdef solve(queries, documents):    tfidf = TfidfVectorizer()    tfidf.fit_transform(documents)    # return the solution in this function    # cosine_similarities_of_queries = solve(queries, documents)    ### BEGIN SOLUTION",
