Is there a way to do this in a generalizable way? I'm basically looking for a way to tell pd.melt that I just want to set value_vars to a list of tuples where in each tuple the first element is the first column level, the second is the second column level, and the third element is the third column level.A:<code>import pandas as pddf = pd.DataFrame({'col1': {0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'c'},                   'col2': {0: 1, 1: 3, 2: 5},                   'col3': {0: 2, 1: 4, 2: 6},                   'col4': {0: 3, 1: 6, 2: 2},                   'col5': {0: 7, 1: 2, 2: 3},                   'col6': {0: 2, 1: 9, 2: 5},                  })df.columns = [list('AAAAAA'), list('BBCCDD'), list('EFGHIJ')]</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
