My question is, is there a way to get the selected column names out from SelectFromModel method?Note that output type is numpy array, and returns important features in whole columns, not columns header. Great thanks if anyone could help me.A:<code>import pandas as pdfrom sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifierfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectFromModelimport numpy as npX, y = load_data()clf = ExtraTreesClassifier(random_state=42)clf = clf.fit(X, y)</code>column_names = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
