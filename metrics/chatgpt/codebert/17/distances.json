Since it's a mask, I want to set the elements of output equal to clean_input_spectrogram where that relevant mask value is 0.How would I do that?A:<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdimport torchmask, clean_input_spectrogram, output= load_data()</code>output = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
