        "from_label": "Problem:Let's say I have a 5D tensor which has this shape for example : (1, 3, 40, 10, 1). I want to split it into smaller equal tensors (if possible) according to a certain dimension with a step equal to 1 while preserving the other dimensions.Let's say for example I want to split it according to the third dimension (=40) where each tensor will have a size equal to 10. So the first tensor_1 will have values from 0->9, tensor_2 will have values from 1->10 and so on.The 31 tensors will have these shapes :Shape of tensor_1 : (1, 3, 10, 10, 1)Shape of tensor_2 : (1, 3, 10, 10, 1)Shape of tensor_3 : (1, 3, 10, 10, 1)...Shape of tensor_31 : (1, 3, 10, 10, 1)Here's what I have tried :a = torch.randn(1, 3, 40, 10, 1)chunk_dim = 10a_split = torch.chunk(a, chunk_dim, dim=2)This gives me 4 tensors. How can I edit this so I'll have 31 tensors with a step = 1 like I explained ?A:<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdimport torcha = load_data()assert a.shape == (1, 3, 10, 40, 1)chunk_dim = 10</code>solve this question with example variable `tensors_31` and put tensors in orderBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
