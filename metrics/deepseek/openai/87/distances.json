I have this DF: #    DateTime       Close   1    2000-01-04    14602    2000-01-05    1470 3    2000-01-06    14804    2000-01-07    1480 5    2000-01-08    1450 I want to get the difference between each row for Close column, but storing a [1,0,-1] value if the difference is positive, zero or negative. And in the first row, please set label 1. I want this result:#    DateTime       Close  label 1    2000-01-04    1460    12    2000-01-05    1470    13    2000-01-06    1480    14    2000-01-07    1480    05    2000-01-08    1450    -1Any solution? ThanksA:<code>import pandas as pddf = pd.DataFrame({'DateTime': ['2000-01-04', '2000-01-05', '2000-01-06', '2000-01-07', '2000-01-08'],                   'Close': [1460, 1470, 1480, 1480, 1450]})</code>df = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
