        "from_label": "Problem:Scipy offers many useful tools for root finding, notably fsolve. Typically a program has the following form:def eqn(x, a, b):    return x + 2*a - b**2fsolve(eqn, x0=0.5, args = (a,b))and will find a root for eqn(x) = 0 given some arguments a and b.However, what if I have a problem where I want to solve for the a variable, giving the function arguments in x and b? Of course, I could recast the initial equation asdef eqn(a, x, b)but this seems long winded and inefficient. Instead, is there a way I can simply set fsolve (or another root finding algorithm) to allow me to choose which variable I want to solve for?Note that the result should be an array of roots for many (x, b) pairs.A:<code>import numpy as npfrom scipy.optimize import fsolvedef eqn(x, a, b):    return x + 2*a - b**2xdata = np.arange(4)+3bdata = np.random.randint(0, 10, (4,))</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
