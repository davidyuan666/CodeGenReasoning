I would like to update the learning rate of the optimizer when loss on training set increases.I have also found this: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate where I can write a scheduler, however, that is not what I want. I am looking for a way to change the value of the learning rate after any epoch if I want.To be more clear, So let's say I have an optimizer:optim = torch.optim.SGD(..., lr=0.005)Now due to some tests which I perform during training, I realize my learning rate is too high so I want to change it. There doesn't seem to be a method optim.set_lr(xxx) but is there some way to do this?And also, could you help me to choose whether I should use lr=0.05 or lr=0.0005 at this kind of situation?A:<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdimport torchoptim = load_data()</code>BEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
