        "from_label": "OriginProblem:Following-up from this question years ago, is there a canonical \"shift\" function in numpy? I don't see anything from the documentation.Using this is like:In [76]: xsOut[76]: array([ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  5.,  6.,  7.,  8.,  9.])In [77]: shift(xs, 3)Out[77]: array([ nan,  nan,  nan,   0.,   1.,   2.,   3.,   4.,   5.,   6.])In [78]: shift(xs, -3)Out[78]: array([  3.,   4.,   5.,   6.,   7.,   8.,   9.,  nan,  nan,  nan])This question came from my attempt to write a fast rolling_product yesterday. I needed a way to \"shift\" a cumulative product and all I could think of was to replicate the logic in np.roll().A:<code>import numpy as npa = np.array([ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  5.,  6.,  7.,  8.,  9.])shift = 3</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
