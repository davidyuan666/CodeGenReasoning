How to do this?I couldn't find a pythonic way of doing this, so any help will be much appreciated.A:<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdexample_lat=np.array([[10, 20, 30],              [20, 11, 33],              [21, 20, 10]])example_lon=np.array([[100, 102, 103],              [105, 101, 102],              [100, 102, 103]])example_val=np.array([[17, 2, 11],              [86, 84, 1],              [9, 5, 10]])def f(lat = example_lat, lon = example_lon, val = example_val):    # return the solution in this function    # df = f(lat, lon,val)    ### BEGIN SOLUTION",
