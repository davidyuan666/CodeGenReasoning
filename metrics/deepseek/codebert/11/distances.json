However the i matrix is expressed as a 1x4 matrix with 1 row. i.e.: [ 12.22151125 4.92815942 2.06380839 0.29766152].How can I get numpy to express the i matrix as a diagonal matrix like so: [[12.22151125, 0, 0, 0],[0,4.92815942, 0, 0],[0,0,2.06380839,0 ],[0,0,0,0.29766152]]Code I am using:a = np.matrix([[3, 4, 3, 1],[1,3,2,6],[2,4,1,5],[3,3,5,2]])U, i, V = np.linalg.svd(a,full_matrices=True)So I want i to be a full diagonal matrix. How an I do this?A:<code>import numpy as npa = np.matrix([[3, 4, 3, 1],[1,3,2,6],[2,4,1,5],[3,3,5,2]])U, i, V = np.linalg.svd(a,full_matrices=True)</code>i = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
