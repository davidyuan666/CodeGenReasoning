I would like to convert it to just one row.So for example if I haveA,B,C,D,E---------1,2,3,4,56,7,8,9,1011,12,13,14,5I want as a result a dataframe with a single row:A_0,B_0,C_0,D_0,E_0,A_1,B_1_,C_1,D_1,E_1,A_2,B_2,C_2,D_2,E_2--------------------------1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,5What would be the most idiomatic way to do this in Pandas?A:<code>import pandas as pdimport numpy as npdf = pd.DataFrame([[1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10],[11,12,13,14,15]],columns=['A','B','C','D','E'])</code>df = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
