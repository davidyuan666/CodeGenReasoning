Currently I have a lil sparse matrix, and not both of sA[i,j] and sA[j,i] have element for any i,j.When populating a large sparse co-occurrence matrix it would be highly inefficient to fill in [row, col] and [col, row] at the same time. What I'd like to be doing is:for i in data:    for j in data:        if have_element(i, j):            lil_sparse_matrix[i, j] = some_value            # want to avoid this:            # lil_sparse_matrix[j, i] = some_value# this is what I'm looking for:lil_sparse.make_symmetric() and it let sA[i,j] = sA[j,i] for any i, j.This is similar to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2572916/numpy-smart-symmetric-matrix\">stackoverflow's numpy-smart-symmetric-matrix question, but is particularly for scipy sparse matrices.A:<code>import numpy as npfrom scipy.sparse import lil_matrixfrom scipy import sparseM= sparse.random(10, 10, density=0.1, format='lil')</code>M = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
