First I did a tf.square(tf.sub(lhs, rhs)) to get[  [1,1,1],  [0,0,0]]and then I want to do an column-wise reduce which returns [  1,1,1]but tf.reduce_sum does not allow my to reduce by column. Any inputs would be appreciated. Thanks.A:<code>import tensorflow as tfa = tf.constant([  [1,1,1],  [0,1,1]])b = tf.constant([  [0,0,1],  [1,1,1]])</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
