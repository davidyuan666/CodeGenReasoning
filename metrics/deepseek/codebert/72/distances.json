This meant the Multi-Column was reduced to a tuple of strings. The get around this issue, prior to the join I used df.columns = [('col_level_0','col_level_1','col_level_2')] for the DataFrame I wished to join.A:<code>import pandas as pdimport numpy as npl = [('A', 'a'),  ('A', 'b'), ('B','a'),  ('B','b')]np.random.seed(1)df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(5, 4), columns=l)</code>df = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
