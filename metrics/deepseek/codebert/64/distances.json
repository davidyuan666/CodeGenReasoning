I had the following four lines of code,import pandas as pdfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoderdf = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')df['Sex'] = LabelEncoder.fit_transform(df['Sex'])But when I ran it I received the following error message:TypeError: fit_transform() missing 1 required positional argument: 'y'the error comes from line 4, i.e.,df['Sex'] = LabelEncoder.fit_transform(df['Sex'])I wonder what went wrong here. Although I know I could also do the transformation using map, which might be even simpler, but I still want to know what's wrong with my usage of LabelEncoder.A:Runnable code<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoderdf = load_data()def Transform(df):    # return the solution in this function    # transformed_df = Transform(df)    ### BEGIN SOLUTION",
