How can I only retrieve the name of the models without its parameters?Or does it mean that I have to create an external list for the names?here I have a piece of code:for model in models:   scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)   print(f'Name model: {model} , Mean score: {scores.mean()}')But I also obtain the parameters:Name model: LinearRegression(copy_X=True, fit_intercept=True, n_jobs=1, normalize=False), Mean score: 0.8066782865537986In fact I want to get the information this way:Name Model: LinearRegression, Mean Score: 0.8066782865537986Any ideas to do that? Thanks!A:<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegressionmodel = LinearRegression()</code>model_name = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
