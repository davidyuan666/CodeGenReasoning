When I run this code with Tensorflow 2, it now throws the exception:RuntimeError: Attempting to capture an EagerTensor without building a function.If I drop the use of Session entirely, is that still functionally equivalent? If I run:import tensorflow as tfA = tf.random.normal([100,100])B = tf.random.normal([100,100])with Session() as sess:    print(tf.reduce_sum(tf.matmul(A,B)))it runs significantly faster (0.005sec vs 30sec) in Tensoflow 1.16 with AVX2 support, whereas stock Tensorflow 2 installed from pip (without AVX2 support) also runs a bit faster (30sec vs 60sec).Why would the use of Session slow down Tensorflow 1.16 by 6000x?A:<code>import tensorflow as tf</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
