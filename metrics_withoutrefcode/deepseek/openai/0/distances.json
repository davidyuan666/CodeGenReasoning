Now 15 = 1111 in binary and so the output should be (1,1,1,1). 2 = 10 in binary and so the output should be (0,0,1,0). If m were 3 then 2 should be converted to (0,1,0).I tried np.unpackbits(np.uint8(num)) but that doesn't give an array of the right length. For example,np.unpackbits(np.uint8(15))Out[5]: array([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=uint8)I would like a method that worked for whatever m I have in the code. Given an n-element integer array, I want to process it as above to generate a (n, m) matrix.A:<code>import numpy as npa = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])m = 8</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
