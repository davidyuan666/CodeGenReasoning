Unlike this answer, I want to sort the matrices according to their sum.My naive reading of the numpy.argsort() documentation:Returns-------index_array : ndarray, int    Array of indices that sort `a` along the specified axis.    In other words, ``a[index_array]`` yields a sorted `a`.led me to believe that I could do my sort with the following code:import numpyprint a\"\"\"[[[ 1.  1.  1.]  [ 1.  1.  1.]  [ 1.  1.  1.]] [[ 3.  3.  3.]  [ 3.  2.  3.]  [ 3.  3.  3.]] [[ 2.  2.  2.]  [ 2.  3.  2.]  [ 2.  2.  2.]]]sum: 26 > 19 > 9\"\"\"b = numpy.arange(3*3*3).reshape((3, 3, 3))print \"b\"print b\"\"\"[[[ 0  1  2]  [ 3  4  5]  [ 6  7  8]] [[ 9 10 11]  [12 13 14]  [15 16 17]] [[18 19 20]  [21 22 23]  [24 25 26]]]Desired output:[[[ 0  1  2]  [ 3  4  5]  [ 6  7  8]] [[18 19 20]  [21 22 23]  [24 25 26]] [[ 9 10 11]  [12 13 14]  [15 16 17]]]What's the right way to do this?A:<code>import numpy as npa = np.random.rand(3, 3, 3)b = np.arange(3*3*3).reshape((3, 3, 3))</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
