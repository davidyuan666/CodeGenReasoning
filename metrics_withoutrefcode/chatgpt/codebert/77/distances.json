For example to save some attributes of the model, so the next time it isn't necessary to call again the fit function to train my model.For example, for GMM I would save the weights_, means_ and covs_ of each component, so for later I wouldn't need to train the model again.Just to make this clear, I am using this for online fraud detection, where this python script would be called many times for the same \"category\" of data, and I don't want to train the model EVERY time that I need to perform a predict, or test action. So is there a general solution?Thanks in advance.A:runnable code<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdfitted_model = load_data()# Save the model in the file named \"sklearn_model\"</code>BEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
