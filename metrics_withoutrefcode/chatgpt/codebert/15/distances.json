What I want to get is a third tensor C, which I expect to have [B,B,N] shape, where the element C[i,j,k] = np.dot(A[i,k,:], B[j,k,:]. I also want to achieve this is a vectorized way.Some further info: The two tensors A and B have shape [Batch_size, Num_vectors, Vector_size]. The tensor C, is supposed to represent the dot product between each element in the batch from A and each element in the batch from B, between all of the different vectors.Hope that it is clear enough and looking forward to you answers!A:<code>import tensorflow as tfimport numpy as npnp.random.seed(10)A = tf.constant(np.random.randint(low=0, high=5, size=(10, 20, 30)))B = tf.constant(np.random.randint(low=0, high=5, size=(10, 20, 30)))</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
