And wondering whether I can insert or delete a step in the pipeline. I saw in the Pipeline source code, there is a self.steps object holding all the steps. We can get the steps by named_steps(). Before modifying it, I want to make sure, I do not cause unexpected effects.Here is a example code:from sklearn.pipeline import Pipelinefrom sklearn.svm import SVCfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCAclf = Pipeline([('AAA', PCA()), ('BBB', LinearSVC())])clfIs it possible that we do something like steps = clf.named_steps(), then insert or delete in this list? Does this cause undesired effect on the clf object?A:Delete any step<code>import numpy as npimport pandas as pdfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipelinefrom sklearn.svm import SVCfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCAfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeaturesestimators = [('reduce_poly', PolynomialFeatures()), ('dim_svm', PCA()), ('sVm_233', SVC())]clf = Pipeline(estimators)</code>solve this question with example variable `clf`BEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
