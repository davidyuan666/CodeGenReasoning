I have this DF: #    DateTime       Close   1    2000-01-04    14602    2000-01-05    1470 3    2000-01-06    14804    2000-01-07    1450  I want to get the difference between each row for Close column, but storing a [1-0] value if the difference is positive or negative. And in the first row, please set label 1. I want this result:#    DateTime       Close  label 1    2000-01-04    1460    12    2000-01-05    1470    13    2000-01-06    1480    14    2000-01-07    1450    0I've done this: df = pd.read_csv(DATASET_path)df['Label'] = 0df['Label'] = (df['Close'] - df['Close'].shift(1) > 1)The problem is that the result is shifted by one row, so I get the difference starting by the second rows instead the first. (Also I got a boolean values [True, False] instead of 1 or 0).This is what I get: #    DateTime       Close  label 1    2000-01-04    1460    2    2000-01-05    1470    True3    2000-01-06    1480    True4    2000-01-07    1450    TrueAny solution? ThanksA:<code>import pandas as pddf = pd.DataFrame({'DateTime': ['2000-01-04', '2000-01-05', '2000-01-06', '2000-01-07'],                   'Close': [1460, 1470, 1480, 1450]})</code>df = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
