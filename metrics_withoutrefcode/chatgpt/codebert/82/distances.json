Danger','Jane Smith', 'Juan de la Cruz']})    name0   Jack Fine1   Kim Q. Danger2   Jane Smith3   Juan de la Cruzand I want to split the name column into 1_name and 2_name IF there is one space in the name. Otherwise I want the full name to be shoved into 1_name.So the final DataFrame should look like:  1_name     2_name0 Jack           Fine1 Kim Q. Danger2 Jane           Smith3 Juan de la CruzI've tried to accomplish this by first applying the following function to return names that can be split into first and last name:def validate_single_space_name(name: str) -> str:    pattern = re.compile(r'^.*( ){1}.*$')    match_obj = re.match(pattern, name)    if match_obj:        return name    else:        return NoneHowever applying this function to my original name_df, leads to an empty DataFrame, not one populated by names that can be split and Nones.Help getting my current approach to work, or solutions invovling a different approach would be appreciated!A:<code>import pandas as pddf = pd.DataFrame({'name':['Jack Fine','Kim Q. Danger','Jane Smith', 'Zhongli']})</code>df = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
