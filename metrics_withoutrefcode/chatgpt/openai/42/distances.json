This can be 3-d array or list with the same order of elements as below:[[[1,5], [2,6]],    [[3,7], [4,8]], [[9,13], [10,14]], [[11,15], [12,16]]]How can do it easily?In my real problem the size of a is (36, 72). I can not do it one by one. I want programmatic way of doing it.A:<code>import numpy as npa = np.array([[1,5,9,13],              [2,6,10,14],              [3,7,11,15],              [4,8,12,16]])</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
