For example, let's say I have a csv file which I read using dask to produce the following dask dataframe:   var1 var21  A    Z,Y2  B    X3  C    W,U,VI would like to convert it to:  var1 var20    A    Z1    A    Y2    B    X3    C    W4    C    U5    C    VI have looked into the answers for Split (explode) pandas dataframe string entry to separate rows and pandas: How do I split text in a column into multiple rows?.I tried applying the answer given in https://stackoverflow.com/a/17116976/7275290 but dask does not appear to accept the expand keyword in str.split.I also tried applying the vectorized approach suggested in https://stackoverflow.com/a/40449726/7275290 but then found out that np.repeat isn't implemented in dask with integer arrays (https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/2946).I tried out a few other methods in pandas but they were really slow - might be faster with dask but I wanted to check first if anyone had success with any particular method. I'm working with a dataset with over 10 million rows and 10 columns (string data). After splitting into rows it'll probably become ~50 million rows.Thank you for looking into this! I appreciate it.A:<code>import pandas as pddf = pd.DataFrame([[\"A\", \"Z,Y\"], [\"B\", \"X\"], [\"C\", \"W,U,V\"]], index=[1,2,3], columns=['var1', 'var2'])</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
