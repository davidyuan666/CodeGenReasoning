For that, I will need to calculate distances between the given input data.Consider the following input data -a = np.array([[1,2,8],     [7,4,2],     [9,1,7],     [0,1,5],     [6,4,3]])What I am looking to achieve here is, I want to calculate distance of [1,2,8] from ALL other points.And I have to repeat this for ALL other points.I am trying to implement this with a FOR loop, but I think there might be a way which can help me achieve this result efficiently.I looked online, but the 'pdist' command could not get my work done. The result should be a symmetric matrix, with element at (i, j) being the distance between the i-th point and the j-th point.Can someone guide me?TIAA:<code>import numpy as npa = np.array([[1,2,8],     [7,4,2],     [9,1,7],     [0,1,5],     [6,4,3]])</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
