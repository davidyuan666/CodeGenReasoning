Then I can get 2nd standard deviation interval, i.e., (μ-2σ, μ+2σ).What I want is detecting outliers of 2nd standard deviation interval from array x. Hopefully result should be a bool array, True for outlier and False for not.A:<code>import numpy as npa = np.array([0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 10, 29, 32, 45])</code>result = ... # put solution in this variableBEGIN SOLUTION<code>",
